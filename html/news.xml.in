Release 0.9.7 solves a long standing problem: how to specify which
values have to be averaged using what type of aggregation function.
This information is now in the XML configuration file.
</p>
<p>
Release 0.9.6 fixes some nasty bugs in the offset code, which even caused
some graphs at low resolution (month and year graphs) to incorrectly
display. Since some of the incorrect code was in the averager class, it
may be necessary to run <strong>meteoavg</strong> to recompute all the
averages. For details about the changes in this release, please see the
<a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.
</p>
<p>
Development of release 0.9.0 was sponsored by the University
<a href="http://www.univates.br/" target="_new">Univates</a> in
<a href="http://www.lajeado.com.br" target="_new">Lajeado</a> in Southern Brazil
(State Rio Grande do Sul).
I would like to thank the University for their generous support,
and all the people involved for their continued help and encouragment.

The current release (version @VERSION@) was published on @CONFIGDATE@.
See the <a href="NEWS">NEWS</a> file for the most important changes

Version 0.9.0 is a major rewrite of many aspects of meteo. 
<ul>
<li>New database structure: the wide tables used in previous releases
have proved too inflexible when adding new fields. Dealing with a
fully equipped VantagePro station would need a much wider table,
a simple Weather Monitor would hardly produce anything but NULL values
in such a table. The database now uses a very narrow table with a
single value per row. See the README file in the db directory of
the distribution.</li>
<li>Configurable set of sensors: The configuration file now specifies
the set of sensors a station is equipped with.</li>
<li>Calibration: station data now is corrected with all the
available calibration numbers.</li>
<li>Extensible design: The software is now much better structured
and adding new sensors or weather stations should be easier now.</li>
</ul>
Without the support of <a href="http://www.univates.br/" target="_new">Univates</a>,
such radical changes would not have been possible.
</p>

<p>Here are some highlights of the recent release history:
Release 0.7.0 comes with a rewrite of the backend, and deals much
better with missing data (NULLs in the database instead of special
values, that loose their special meaning when averagin).
Release 0.8.0 introduces a new graphing backend which is much
more flexible than in previous releases.

Walter Poxon has contributed an
<a href="meteo-install.html" target="_top">Installation Howto</a>
(thanks Walter!),
which goes into some more detail. He also wrote some scripts to upload
weather data to the
<a href="http://www.weatherunderground.com/" target="_new">Weather Underground</a>
(these scripts no longer work with the new database, hopefully they
will be updated in a future release).
His work was for for a previous release, and some things have changed
slightly, but it is still helpful as a guide through the installation.
