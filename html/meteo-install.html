<h2>Installing meteo</h2>
<h3>Stuff you need on your system before compiling meteo:</h3>
<p>Meteo installs fairly easily if you have the right pre-requisite
packages installed on your system.</p>
<p><br>
  Here's a list of what I had to install (in roughly the order I needed to
  install them) in order for meteo to install/build properly:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install mysql, perl, and the latest apache first.</p>
<p><br>
  These are all independent of one another, but will be tied together by the
  subsequent pieces. All the version numbers above should be treated as
  minimums.
  If something newer is out there, I'd use it. Note that there are also
  some version constraints between some of the packages above, e.g.
  some libxslt version usually requires a minimum libxml2 version.</p>
<p><br>
  PHP in particular requires minimum versions &gt;= those above of all the above
pieces.</p>
<p><br>
Then install the DBI, DBD, libwww-perl, the pm/php stuff, and everything else.
Note that the perl stuff is needed only for the weatherunderground portion.</p>
<p><br>
  It goes without saying to do a &quot;make test&quot; on each of these pieces
  (if available) to make sure all the individual pieces work.<br>
  The last piece (which will use all of them) is meteo. Meteo will build properly
  with just the above installed. It will not run or look right, however, unless
  you follow the docs in the db directory of the meteo distribution
  on setting up additional users (first as unix users and then again separately
  in the database user admin stuff) for the two functions of meteo. Meteo uses
  a separate
  unix user
  + database user for data collection (read+write perms to the database tables)
and the graphing stuff (read-only perms) to the database.</p>
<h2>Configuring meteo:</h2>
<h3>Info on configuring meteo:</h3>
<p>You need to set up the users and tables in your mysql database.</p>
<p><br>
  Make sure the mysql daemon is running, then check out the README in the db
    directory.</p>
<p><br>
  You'll need to first set up two unix accounts (named mtp and meteo - see
      below). Do these first, then create the necessary database users and tables
      in mysql
  according to the README in the db directory.</p>
<p><br>
  If you want to see a working example, log in to www.poxon.net<br>
  Files you'll want to snarf:<br>
  /usr/local/etc/meteo.xml (the main config file for the whole thing)</p>
<p><br>
  <h3>Set up mtp user account</h3>
<p>Meteo can run as any user, so you may choose to run it as root, or as
some other user already defined on your system. It is, however, good system
administration practice to use a dedicated user. The mtp user 
used for reading data from the station and writing it to the database
needs access to the station (a serial interface like <tt>/dev/ttyS0</tt>,
give this device to mtp, or via TCP to a device server), and needs
insert and upate rights in the database.
</p>
<p>
Another user meteo can be set up who will generate the images, this user
only needs read access to the database (select).
</p>
<ol>
<li> Create a user named mtp
<li>
Create this crontab for user mtp (runs davis_collect_data every 2 mins)
<pre>
*/2 * * * * /usr/home/mtp/davis_collect_data</p>
</pre>

Here's what the davis_collect_data script looks like:</p>
<pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    ps -ax | grep -v grep | grep meteopoll &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
    if [ $? -eq 1 ] ; then
    /usr/local/bin/meteopoll -f /usr/local/etc/meteo.xml \
        -d -F -sOakwood &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
    else
    # echo &quot;meteopoll already running&quot;
    fi
</pre>
<li>Set up meteo user:
  this is for running the meteograph program which
  reads
info from the database and generates the graphs for you)
<li>
Create this crontab for user meteo:</p>
<pre>
    WWW=/usr/local/apache/www.poxon.net/htdocs/weather<br>
    WEATHER_GRAPH=&quot;/usr/local/bin/meteograph -f /usr/local/etc/meteo.xml -s
    Oakwood&quot;
    */2 * * * * /usr/home/meteo/davis_average_data
    # every 5 mins, graph daily graphs for weather
    */5 * * * * $WEATHER_GRAPH -c $WWW 300
    # at 5 mins after the hour, do weekly graphs
    5 * * * * $WEATHER_GRAPH -c $WWW -a 1800
    # at 15 mins after the hour, do monthly graphs
    15 * * * * $WEATHER_GRAPH -c $WWW -a 7200
    # at 25 mins after the hour, do yearly graphs
    25 * * * * $WEATHER_GRAPH -c $WWW -a 86400
</pre>
Note the -a options to the graph program, it ensures that the precomputed
averages in the meteoaverage table are used, which is essential
for performance. While during the first few weeks you can easily live
without the -a option, after about half a year you will start to wonder
why your database server behaves so sluggish.
</ol>

<h2>Stuff for uploading data to Weather Underground</h2>

<p>see wunderground directory.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2.

<ul>
<li>re-work scripts for keeping meteopoll and meteoavg running (since they're
  supposed to run forever anyway). Instead of cron job which runs every 2 mins,
  switch to using a loop in /etc/rc.local to only re-invoke them if they exit
  (using a subshell).
</li>
