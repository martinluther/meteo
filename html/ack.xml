Over time, many people have contributed by submitting bug reports
(the bugs themselves were all my fault, of course). I tried to
keep track of them in the AUTHORS file, please send me mail if I
forgot someone.

Some customers have supported meteo by buying support for installation
and configuration of a weather station, but have choosen to
remain anonymous, at least on the meteo web site.
