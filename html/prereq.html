<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>Generally speaking, <b>meteo</b> is quite lean, at least for current
hardware. The reference installation is on a dual 60MHz processor
SPARCstation 20 with 200MB of RAM, this can hardly be called current,
Sun has canceled support for this platform for several years now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disk space:</strong>
To build meteo on a Linux system, you need at least 150MB of disk space,
the installed libraries with debug symbols take about 45MB (they become
considerably smaller if you strip them), the installed programms use
about 5.5MB. On Solaris, the shared library is smaller, but the
archive library is larger. The binaries are linked against the
shared libraries by default.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CPU:</strong> While compiling the software can take some
time (it takes about an hour on the reference machine),
running meteo hardly produces any noticeable load on current hardware.
On the meteo website server, meteo's activities account for hardly more
than about 10% of the CPU load. The most important portion of CPU load comes
from the database, the meteo programs themselves cause less than 1% of
the CPU load.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Database space:</strong> 
The most important requirement for meteo is database space. A VantagePro Plus
station uses about 970kB in the <i>sdata</i>, <i>avg</i> and <i>header</i>
per day of database space, or about 343MB per year. On october 30th, 2003,
the database on the meteo website was about 1.4GB in size and contained
more than 47mio rows in the three large tables, more than 30mio rows
in the <i>sdata</i> table alone.
