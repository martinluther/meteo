Univates in Lajeado, RS, Brazil.

Over time, many people have contributed by submitting bug reports
(the bugs themselves were all my fault, of course). I tried to
keep track of them in the AUTHORS file, please send me mail if I
forgot someone.

This software was mainly developed by
<a href="mailto:andreas.mueller@othello.ch">Andreas M&uuml;ller</a>,
contributions by others are detailed in the <a href="http://meteo.othello.ch/AUTHORS">AUTHORS</a>.
You can also see the <a href="http://meteo.othello.ch/temp.html">server room
temperature</a> where the main development machine lives.
The new web site design is by my 13 year old daughter
