<h1>Meteo Data</h1>
<p>
This page describes the meteo data graphs as generated by the meteo
software package. This package collects data from a Davis Instruments
station into a MySQL database. The data is averaged over sampling
intervals of 300, 1800, 7200 or 86400 seconds, and display in graphs
spanning a day, a week, a month or a year.
</p>
<p>
The description below assumes the default colors as specified in the
sample <b>meteo.conf</b> distributed with the package.
</p>
<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>
The <font color="#990000">red</font> curve shows the temperature,
the <font color="#ff9999">light red</font> area shows the range between
maximum and minimum temperature during the sampling interval.
The <font color="#6666ff">blue</font> curve shows the dew point, the
temperature at which dew begins to form.
</p>
<h2>Barometric Pressure</h2>
<p>
The <font color="#6666ff">blue</font> graph shows
average barometric pressure, the range between minimum and maximum
pressure during the sampling interval is shown in
<font color="#ccccff">light blue</font>.
</p>
<h2>Wind</h2>
<p>
The lower part of the graph shows in <font color="#00ff00">light green</font>
the average wind speed during the sampling interval, the maximum speed
is shown in <font color="#006600">dark green</font>, scale on the
left of the graph. The upper part
shows the wind azimut in <font color="#6666ff">blue</font>, scale on the
right.
</p>
<p>
Averaging the wind is not trivial. The meteo package samples wind
every few seconds and computes the displacement vector for each of
this short intervals. The vectors are then all added up, the average
speed is the length of the total displacement vector devided by the
averaging interval (one minute).
</p>
<h2>Solar Radiation</h2>
<p>
The <font color="#cc9900">gold</font> histogram shows
the total solar radiation in W/m^2, scale on the left of the graph.
The <font color="#6600cc">pink</font> curve shows the UV index,
scale on the right.
</p>
<p>
Note that after snow fall the readings of both sensors are not reliably,
as the sensors are not automatically freed of the snow.
</p>
<h2>Precipitation</h2>
<p>
The <font color="0000ff">blue</font> histogram shows
the total rain (or moisture content of snow of the precipitation) in
<i>mm</i> during the sampling interval.
</p>
<p>
As fresh snow consists mostly of air, it isn't trivial to determine the
amount of snow from the reading of the rain sensor. A factor of ten
is not unusual: 7cm of fresh snow boil down to only 7mm of rain.
