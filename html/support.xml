<p>
If you need help setting up meteo, consider asking the mailing list.
You must be subscribed to the mailing list if you want to post, send
a message with the single word <code>subscribe</code> in the body to
<a href="mailto:meteo-request@lists.othello.ch">meteo-request@lists.othello.ch</a>.
</p>
<p>
You may also send mail to the author, but your problem may actually take
longer to be resolved, as I cannot always respond in a timely manner.
