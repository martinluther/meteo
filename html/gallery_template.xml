  <comment>Altendorf was built as a prototype for the station in Bosco/Gurin,
    which as originally intended for tourist information. However, the
    temperature graphs were considered to sophisticated by the marketing types,
    and are no longer shown on the tourist information page of Bosco/Gurin.
