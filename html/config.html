<h1>Configuring the software</h1>
<p>
After the software has been installed, it must be configured.
Follow the steps below for a successful configuration:
</p>
<h2>Configuration file: meteo.xml</h2>
<p>
Most configuration happens inside the 
<strong>meteo.xml</strong>(5) configuration file. A sample file is include
with the distribution. To find out what sensor names are known for
a particular station type, use the <strong>meteosensors</strong>(1) utility.
</p>
<h2>Processes</h2>
<p>
For details of the configuration of all the programs, please consult
the manual pages installed with the distribution. This page only describes
there principal functions and relation to each other.
</p>
<h3>Daemons</h3>
<p>
A full fledged meteo installation uses 3 permanently running processes
and some cron jobs to do its work. The processes and there functions are:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>metepoll</dt>
<dd>This program talks to the weather station, collects data from its sensors
and writes new records to the <code>sdata</code> table every minute.
There are actually two copies of meteopoll: one copy does the actual work,
the other acts as a watchdog. If the working copy gets killed, e.g. by
a communications timeout, the watchdog copy spawns a new worker to try to
contact the weather station again. <strong>meteopoll</strong>(1)
does not write to the database. The database my be locked by long running
queries for extended periods of time, waiting for the database would
make <strong>meteopoll</strong>(1) loose some data. To prevent this,
<strong>meteopoll</strong>(1) usually writes the updates to a message queue,
and  lets the <strong>meteodequeue</strong>(1) program add them to the
database.
</dd>
<dt>meteodequeue</dt>
<dd>This program opens the messages queue and reads updates which it
then sends to the database.
</dd>
<dt>meteoavg</dt>
<dd>
The meteoavg program computes the averages needed for graphing.
This program can also be used to rebuild the <code>avg</code> table 
from the <code>sdata</code> table.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The sample start script <code>rc.meteo</code> in the support directory
of the distribution starts all three processes at once.
</p>
<h3>Cron Jobs</h3>
<p>
In addition to these daemons, you need to run <strong>meteodraw</strong>(1)
periodically to generate updated graphs for the web site.
A sample cron job script is included in the distribution.
</p>
<h3>PHP scripts</h3>
<p>
To top off the installation, configure the meteo browser to allow
graphical browsing of the meteo database.
See the <a href="http://meteo.othello.ch/README.browser">README.browser</a> for details.
