<p><h1>Configuring the software</h1>
<p>
After the software has been installed, it must be configured.
Follow the steps below for a successful configuration:
<ol>
<li>
Most configuration happens inside the 
<b>meteo.xml</b>(5) configuration file. A sample file is include
with the distribution. To find out what sensor names are known for
a particular station type, use the <b>meteosensors</b>(1) utility.
</li>
<li>
A minimal installation will run one instance of <b>meteopoll</b>(1)
to collect data from the weather station and write it to the database
(with the <b>-b mysql</b> option to directly write the data to the
database).
It will also use

<b>meteoavg</b>(1) to compute averages and store them in the
averages table.
Furthermore, it will run a cron job using
<b>meteodraw</b>(1) to update the graphs for the web page, a sample
cron job script is included in the distribution.
</li>
<li>
More sophisticated installations will make use of the decoupling
of weather station and database through a message queue, which involves
running the <b>meteopoll</b>(1) program with the <b>-b msgqueue</b> option,
and in addition running an instance of the dequeuer process
<b>meteodequeue</b>(1).
</li>
<li>
To top off the installation, configure the meteo browser to allow
graphical browsing of the meteo database.
See the <a href="http://meteo.othello.ch/README.browser">README.browser</a> for details.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
For details of the configuration of all these programs, please consult
the manual pages installed with the distribution.
