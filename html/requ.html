<p><h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>Generally speaking, <b>meteo</b> is quite lean,
<p>
<strong>Disk space:</strong>
To build meteo on a Linux system, you need at least 150MB of disk space,
the installed libraries with debug symbols take about 45MB (they become
considerably smaller if you strip them), the installed programms use
about 5.5MB.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CPU:</strong> While compiling the software can take some
time (it takes about an hour on the dual processor SPARCstation 20
that hosts the meteo website http://meteo.othello.ch/),
running meteo hardly produces any noticeable load on current hardware.
On the meteo website server, meteo's activities account for hardly more
than about 10% of the CPU load. The most important portion of CPU load comes
from the database, the meteo programs themselves cause less than 1% of
the CPU load.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Database space:</strong> 
The most important requirement for meteo is database space. A VantagePro Plus
station uses about 970kB in the <i>sdata</i>, <i>avg</i> and <i>header</i>
per day of database space, or about 343MB per year. On october 30th, 2003,
the database on the meteo website was about 1.4GB in size and contained
more than 47mio rows an the three large tables, more than 30mio rows
in the <i>sdata</i> table alone.
