<h1>Utilities</h1>
<p>
Some utilities included in the package are not documented in manual
pages. Here is a short description of these tools:
<dl>
<dt><b>meteojob</b></dt>
<dd>This script can be run from cron to recompute exactly those
graphs that need updating. The script is not very sophisticated,
e.g. it does not check whether the graphs have previously been
generated, but it can be used as a starting point for a more elaborate
solution.</dd>
<dt><b>meteooverview</b></dt>

<dd>Run with exactly one argument, the name of the station, this script
generates HTML pages in the current directory with embedded tags linking
to the graphs. The pages show overviews of all parameters for either a day,
a week, a month or a year, or an overview of only one parameter over all
these periods on one page.
The pages at <a href="http://grossalp.othello.ch/meteo/" target="_new">http://grossalp.othello.ch/meteo/</a> have been generated with this script.
Again, the script isn't very intelligent, but helpful as a start.
</dd>
<dt><b>meteolast</b></dt>
<dd>retrieves the last entry from the database and formats it as either
text or XML.
</dd>
<dt><b>meteodbdump</b></dt>
<dd>Dump the contents of the database to text files. Since the meteo
tables tend to be extremely large (dozens of millions of rows, hundrets
of megabytes), mysqldump from the MySQL distribution cannot dump the
tables. And even if it could, it would interfere with normal operation
of meteo. <b>meteodbdump</b> allows to dump the database without noticable
impact on the other meteo programs.</dd>
