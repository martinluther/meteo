Translating the meteobrowser
----------------------------

If you want to translate the meteobrowser interface, start from the
meteobrowser.pot file, and copy it to a file named after your locale
with the extension of .po. Then provide translations in all the
msgstr lines.

You will also need to modify the Makefile.am so that your .mo file will
be generated and installed. Note that the Apache server caches .mo files,
and will crash if you replace it, i.e. by installing a new version. It is
necessary to stop and start the server.
