Database installation
---------------------

The meteo package expects to store the data in a mysql database. This
allows to keep high resolution data an averages readily available for
meteograph to easily produce graphs for any time during the measurement
interval.

The script meteo.sql creates the necessary tables. Connect as a privileged
user to the MySQL server and create a database:

	mysql> create database meteo;

Then run the meteo.sql script against this database:

	$ mysql -u user -p meteo < meteo.sql
	Enter password: ...

After the database is created, you must grant the meteo users access to
the tables. You will usually want to have two users: one for meteodequeue
only to update the tables, the other for meteograph to read off data and
draw graphs. The commands for the read only user will look like

	mysql> grant select on stationdata to meteo@localhost 
		identified by 'public';
	mysql> grant select on averages to meteo@localhost;
	mysql> flush privileges;

and for the read/write user:

	mysql> grant select, insert on stationdata to mtp@localhost 
		identified by 'private';
	mysql> grant select, insert on averages to mtp@localhost;
	mysql> flush privilges;

Enter username and password also in your meteo.conf file.
