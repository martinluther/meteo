	Bruce Hewitson		pointed out a bug in meteodata.c
	Walter Poxon		contributed wunderground directory
				pointed out a bug in the wake up code
	Michal Szymanski	pointed out the problem with localtime
				and daylight saving time
				also requested that undefined values be
				handled more gracefully
	Michael Niedermann	requested an option for dynamic graphs
				(I'm still working on a rewrite of the graph
				programs)
				Pointed out an open problem with week numbering
				in the graphs (will be fixed during the
				rewrite)
	Wolfgang Ruthner	pointed out a header problem with BSD,
				this problem has (hopefully) gone with
				the rewrite of the station interface code
	Stefan Feuz		noted a problem with the wakeup code
				and debugging, and some documentation
				problems
	Tom Easterday 		helped with debugging on Mac OS X
	Giacomo A. Catenazzi	submitted two bug reports for bugs he
				found while preparing a debian package
	Chance C. Geurin	noted a problem with signed data, I only
				hope the new version does this right!
	Tiago Giovanaz da Silva & Cesar Brod
				contributed a portuguese translation of the
				browser (locale pt_BR, file pt_BR.po)
	Josep Sort		pointed out a bug affecting Weather Monitor II,
				introduced when meteo started to read the
				rain calibration number from the station. 
				It caused rain data to be wildly incorrect.
	Jeff Wabik		contributed many very good ideas and lots
				of code: connected and disconnected graphs,
				(to continue graphs through stretches where
				there is no data, which was the normal behaviour
				in very old releases before there was the nodata
				stuff), the accumulation function, which is very
				helpful for rain graphs (he had it for rain,
				I turned it into a generic function), and
				transparency for the nodata (I turned that into
				transparency everywhere, one can now more easily
				combine temperature and humidity, where hum.
				shines through the temperature range graph where
				necessary)
	Aaron Spike		volunteered to test early releases of meteo
				0.9.0 on a GrowWeather
	Carmen Mueller		(http://carmen.othello.ch) contributed the
				new meteo web site design
	Carsten Guenther	found a bug in ReaderInfo.cc, where all the
				extra humidity readers had the same name
