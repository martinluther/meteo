0.5.1 adds the possiblity to write the updates to a file instead of the
      database. I intend to use this feature to create a highly available
      setup (well, at least for the computers, if the station fails, I cannot
      prevent data loss).

0.5.0 converts the configuration file to XML. It also fixes some minor
      bugs.

0.4.0 modfies the format of the database, please read support/How_to_migrate
      for instructions about how to convert to the new format.
