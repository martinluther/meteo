This is a bugfix release. It fixes some minor issues with the meteobrowser
introduced in 0.2.0. Here is what the ChangeLog has to say about changes
for this release:

Release 0.2.1:
	* fix meteobrowser.php to rebuild only as few graphs as possible,
	  but all the necessary ones.
	* improve the visual appearance of the browser, by adding cute
	  icons produced by GIMP, and a style sheet.
	* fix meteograph to shadow noexisting data also at the end of
	  the graph
	* add ALT tags to image maps and to navigation bar.
