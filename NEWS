0.3.4 adds support for the new release of the Vantage Pro firmware.
It is now possible to generate graphs with humidity alone (previously,
humidity was only available in the for of the dew point). 

The meteobrowser now works with PHP 4.2 or if you have register globals
turned of, which is the default starting with 4.2.

Some minor bugs have also been fixed.
