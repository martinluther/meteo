0.8.6	Attention: the configuration file syntax has changed slightly:
	the unit tag inside the station is no longer supported, use the
	units tag just inside the meteo tag.

0.8.1-6	Many bug fixes in the new graphing code. Especially the addition of
	an accumulation function (very useful for rain) has shown that we
	are on the right track.

0.8.0	This release comes with a complete rewrite of the graphing engine.
	Graphs can now be specified completely in XML, there are only very
	few items left that cannot be specified in the XML file.
