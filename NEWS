0.9.10	turn of CRC0 for GroWeather and possibly other type E weatherlinks.

0.9.9	A hack to protect from IE reading the complete meteobrowser.php
	space offline

0.9.8	fixes a integer overflow bug: to compute the time labels for the
	maps, GraphWindow.cc used the formular (start + end)/2, but since
	about the middle of january, this causes an overflow, so that the
	target ends up in february 1936. Replace that by start/2 + end/2.
	
0.9.7	some bug fixes
	removal of offset configuration variable
	added averages configuration in XML file, so the user now gets full
	control about which averages are compute, and how
	battery and transmitter fields now work
	sunrise and sunset can also be stored in the database (this is a
		waste of space, but who cares about a few gibabytes these
		days)
	added channel of type sun, which indicates the time during which
		the sun is above the horizon

0.9.6	some bug fixes
	removal of header table

0.9.5	some minor fixes

(for further news please check the ChangeLog)

0.9.0	Major rewrite of many aspects of meteo sponsored by the University
	Univates in Lajeado in Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. Further
	contributions: Jeff Wabik (new derived value computations).
