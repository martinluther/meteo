This is a bugfix release. It fixes some minor issues with the meteobrowser
introduced in 0.2.0. Here is what the ChangeLog has to say about changes
for this release:

Release 0.2.2:
	* made sure navigation is not possible into the future and before
	  the first data point (to prevent robots from creating havoc)
	* added --with-browser-dir configuration for automated installation
	  of the meteo browser
	* converted HTML comments in meteobrowser.php to PHP comments so that
	  the resulting page is smaller and thus (hopefully) faster
	* removed the stationlist.inc, and replaced it by a meteobrowser.inc
	  containing all the configuration data
	* improve the time information in the title of the meteobrowser
	* created really meaningful ALT tags for the graphs (there were
	  month names and weekday names in 0.2.1 in the week and year
	  graphs, but now a uniq tag including date or date range is
	  supplied in all graphs (except day, of course).

Release 0.2.1:
	* fix meteobrowser.php to rebuild only as few graphs as possible,
	  but all the necessary ones.
	* improve the visual appearance of the browser, by adding cute
	  icons produced by GIMP, and a style sheet.
	* fix meteograph to shadow noexisting data also at the end of
	  the graph
	* add ALT tags to image maps and to navigation bar.
