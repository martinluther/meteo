0.9.15	new interface which allows to read current readings from the console
	to display on the web page. The new -m option to meteopoll makes
	sure current data is written to a file (the argument to the option)
	in XML format. Since updates to this file are very frequent, one
	should read the file atomically, one should use the meteomap program
	to read the data.
	fix of a nasty bug in the week label code, causing navigation failure
	at week resolution in some cases

0.9.14	gallery files included as samples
	can now compute sunrise and sunset (through meteosunriset and Sun.cc)

0.9.13	minor bug in meteobrowser.php
	gallery pages

0.9.12	some minor fixes, plus a security fix: remote code execution in
	meteobrowser.php because of missing escapeshellcmd

0.9.11	some bug fixes for GroWeather

0.9.10	turn of CRC0 for GroWeather and possibly other type E weatherlinks.

0.9.9	A hack to protect from IE reading the complete meteobrowser.php
	space offline

0.9.8	fixes a integer overflow bug: to compute the time labels for the
	maps, GraphWindow.cc used the formular (start + end)/2, but since
	about the middle of january, this causes an overflow, so that the
	target ends up in february 1936. Replace that by start/2 + end/2.
	
0.9.7	some bug fixes
	removal of offset configuration variable
	added averages configuration in XML file, so the user now gets full
	control about which averages are compute, and how
	battery and transmitter fields now work
	sunrise and sunset can also be stored in the database (this is a
		waste of space, but who cares about a few gibabytes these
		days)
	added channel of type sun, which indicates the time during which
		the sun is above the horizon

0.9.6	some bug fixes
	removal of header table

0.9.5	some minor fixes

(for further news please check the ChangeLog)

0.9.0	Major rewrite of many aspects of meteo sponsored by the University
	Univates in Lajeado in Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. Further
	contributions: Jeff Wabik (new derived value computations).
