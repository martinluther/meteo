This directory contains interface programs to retrieve data from a
Davis Instruments weather station. The architecture is sufficiently
generic to acommodate other weather stations as well.

These programs use a URL type description of the weather-station
to talk to and the parameters necessary to connect. There are basically 
two methods to connect to a weather station: 

 1. through a direct serial connection, indicated by an URL of the
    form 

	file:///dev/ttyS0

    this form allows for things that are not really devices like pipes
    to other processes that themselves get the data from a `real'
    device. It even allows for Unix domain sockets.

 2. through a TCP connection to a terminal server that has the weather
    station connected to one of its serial ports, indicated by a 
    URL of the form

	tcp://hostname:port

On a higher level, data retrieved through such a connection should be
presented in a standard format. The established way seem to be weather
telegrams, but this format is not easily extensible and cannot be
deal with historical data. XML seems to be a much better option:

 1. it is to some degree human readable, and is completely machine
    independent. In particular, no considerations about byte order
    are necessary.
 2. parsers are readily available for many languages, returning
    the data in machine readable form.
 3. the DTD can specify constructs fuer historical data, and declare
    them optional.
