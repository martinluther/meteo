Release 0.1.7:
	* fixed a bug in meteoavg.c, which did not daemonize by default,
	  and did not honor the -p option
	* some nasty Bourne shell bug on Solaris overly complicates
	  configuration on that platform
	* mailinglist has been set up
	* added watchdog functionality, but not tested thouroughly
	* fixed a bug in get_acknowledge that resulted in incorrect
	  behavior if the station did not reply

Release 0.1.6:
	* added documentation: meteo.html and meteodata.html
	* added the capability to become a daemon to the meteoavg, meteoloop
	  and meteodequeue programs
	* added a -a option to meteograph that forces the use of the average
	  table. Use the meteoavg program to fill the averages table
	* added an option to meteograph that allows to select the graphs to
	  be produced
	* message queues are now fully implemented to decouple data collection
	  from the wheather station and updates of the database. So if the
	  database blocks (e.g. because of a long running query), no data
	  from the station is lost.
	* fixed quite a serious bug in the computation of the total wind
	  speed. It worked for the Monitor, where the updates follow
	  roughly every second, but it failed for the vantage, where the
	  updates take 5 seconds.
	* fixed quite a serious unit conversion bug in the davis_loop
	  function
	* added wake up code: Vantage station needs a wake up signal before
	  the first command is sent
	* added speed directive to configuration file: serial speed is
	  now configurable
	* portability fixes for Linux
	* added generic functions to compute averages
	* added a program to compute averages after the fact
	* added a new table to the database to hold averages, so that the
	  computation of the averages doesn't take that much time any longer
	  (we should be able to do it from a CGI program)
	* unified configuration file reading with a single new function in
	  mconf.c

Release 0.1.5:
	* modify meteoloop so that it reads a configuration file
	* meteograph did not close the configuration file after being done
	  with it
	* allow to configure writer as well as the read only user from the
	  configuration file

Release 0.1.4:
	* fix a bug in labeling code, weekly labels were no longer displayed
	  after change to daylight saving time
	* implemented a configuration file scanner/parser to be
	  able to configure ranges and colors of the graphs without modifying
	  the source code
	* database connection parameters configurable through the configuration
	  file

Release 0.1.3:
	* fix bug in year labeling code, labels now appear
	* adapt precipitation display ranges to something more reasonable
	* fix dotted line for transparency

Release 0.1.2:
	* fix a bug in temperature max/min display (they were simply wrong)
	* added some support for message queues, not finished

Release 0.1.1:
	* improve the graphs with better scales for wind
	* improve the graph API by decoupling grid and ticks
	* added a sync function to the davis interface code (based on
	  the timed read)
	* added a time read function to the meteocom structure
	* add memory debugging to all source files
	* fix missing include for string.h in tcpcom.c

Release 0.1.0:
	* meteotest now retrieves a full data set and displays it in HTML
	* added conversion functions for temperature, wind speed and
	  barometric pressure
	* liboolized/automakeized/autoconfized/shtoolized the package
