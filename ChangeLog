Release 0.7.0:
	* added wundgerground contribution by Walter Poxon
	* fixed many documentation bugs related to obsolete programs and
	  versions
	* switching between english and metric units is now possible without
	  hacking the code, although it is not very elegant yet, at least
	  as far as the graphing code is concerned (no problem with the
	  station interface code, which already uses the C++ implementation)
	* added CRC checking, the crc computation code was there, but it was
	  never used
	* checked that it still compiles on Solaris 2.6
	* checked that it works on Mac OS X

Release 0.6.1:
	* added uds10 description file
	* started rewriting meteoloop, now called meteopoll in C++

Release 0.6.0:
	* compiles on Mac OS X, and is partially tested
	* added Unix domain socket code so that platforms that don't have
	  message queues can still somewhat decouple the station from
	  the database. note that msg queues are used if they are present,
	  they allow for messages to be stored even if the server has gone
	  away or is not ready yet, and it is trivial to have several
	  listeners (dequeuers) on the queue that can process messages
	  in parallel.

Release 0.5.1:
	* first release also built with gcc 3
	* add a new target to send the updates to: an ordinary file (we'll
	  use this to build a highly available solution. This is also
	  the reason why only meteoloop has that feature, and not
	  meteoaverage: It is intended for situations where no database
	  is available).
	* add a valid flag to all data types, so that we can always decide
	  whether the data we have is OK (we probably should rewrite part
	  of meteo in C++ with intelligent datatypes that can have value
	  `NIL' and built in formatting for SQL).
	* make sure the graphs retrieve only valid data from the database

Release 0.5.0:
	* convert configuration file format to XML, and try to make the
	  documentation about the configuration file more precise
	* fix ambiguity between <max> and <scale>
	* converted default colors to colors from the web palette (6x6x6
	  color cube) to prevent dithering on low color resolution displays.

Release 0.4.0:
	* add migration utility meteofixtimestamps and describe how migration
	  should be done in How_to_migrate in the support directory
	* add some help about the use of CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS in INSTALL
	* convert to unix timestamps in database (MySQL lacks functions to
	  specify the time zone of a timestamp, it expects us to know the
	  servers time zone, and to provide timestamps in the right time
	  zone for the server).
	* try to make sure configure blows up if one of the required libraries
	  mysql, gd or png cannot be linked
	* Type in meteoavg.c option parsing
	* add -a flag to support/meteojob, because otherwise the database
	  will get slow
	* fix some missing includes

Release 0.3.4:
	* added individual graphs for humidity and humidity_inside
	* updated autoconf/automake to newer releases (2.52/1.5)
	* added support for the new Vantage Pro releases: Davis has changed
	  the data returned from the LOOP command to include barometric trend,
	  breaking compatibility
	* changed the meteobrowser.php script to use HTTP_GET_VARS throughout,
	  so that it does work with the defaults of PHP 4.2 (though you should
	  use even newer releases of PHP because of security issues)
	* improve error messages to simplify debugging

Release 0.3.3:
	* fixed a sprintf format bug in meteodata.c:221
	* added db/README explaining how to set up the database

Release 0.3.2:
	* make sure the dewpoint function never returns a nan, as this may
	  stall drawing a temperature graph
	* added background colors to the wind graph so that the general
	  direction of the wind is more easily discernible.
	* added clipping to the graph.c functions
	* gave the meteograph programm the capability to display scales
	  depending on the interval not only for rain, but also for all
	  other channels.
	* add functions to retrieve configuration variables based on the
	  four components of the property
	* PHP 4.1.1 emits a warning when stat'ing a file that does not exist
	  (I really disagree with the PHP developers: in Unix one really
	  uses stat to find out whether a file exists...
	* fixed a bug in metebrowser.php that prevented the language variable
	  to be correctly set to the default if it wasn't set previously.

Release 0.3.1:
	* fixed signal handling to protect the master from being kill by signals
	  sent to the child's process group (i.e. for terminal signals which
	  we don't want to be blocked from the child)
	* added signal handling to master/slave frame work in meteoloop so
	  that SIGTERM and SIGINT on the master also terminate the child,
	  as required for well working start/stop scripts
	* completed work on localization of the meteobrowser, including date
	  localization
	* added a master/slave configuration to meteoloop, so that the
	  master can always fork a new child if the the previous child dies
	* switched logging to the new mdebug functions so that the log
	  can be written to syslog
	* added po directory for localizations of the meteo browser
	* added the explanations to the browser window
	* added functions to send parser debug log to common log system
	* added a drain function to com.c, so that it is now possible to
	  for some time read spurious characters from the station and
	  throw them away

Release 0.3.0:
	* fix minor off-by-one bug in meteograph that hid the last data point
	  behind the nodatat color although the data did exist
	* completely reorganized the source code, as the number of files
	  in the top level directory has grown quite large by now.

Release 0.2.2:
	* made sure navigation is not possible into the future and before
	  the first data point (to prevent robots from creating havoc)
	* added --with-browser-dir configuration for automated installation
	  of the meteo browser
	* converted HTML comments in meteobrowser.php to PHP comments so that
	  the resulting page is smaller and thus (hopefully) faster
	* removed the stationlist.inc, and replaced it by a meteobrowser.inc
	  containing all the configuration data
	* improve the time information in the title of the meteobrowser
	* created really meaningful ALT tags for the graphs (there were
	  month names and weekday names in 0.2.1 in the week and year
	  graphs, but now a uniq tag including date or date range is
	  supplied in all graphs (except day, of course).

Release 0.2.1:
	* fix meteobrowser.php to rebuild only as few graphs as possible,
	  but all the necessary ones.
	* improve the visual appearance of the browser, by adding cute
	  icons produced by GIMP, and a style sheet.
	* fix meteograph to shadow noexisting data also at the end of
	  the graph
	* add ALT tags to image maps and to navigation bar.

Release 0.2.0:
	* added the meteobrowser.php script, which allows to graphically
	  browse the complete database, this is currently only a first
	  approximation.
	* add option -t to meteograph to include timestamps in file names
	  generated

Release 0.1.9:
	* optionally color the background in graphs if no data available

Release 0.1.8:
	* fixed meteooverview to produce better results
	* fix a bug in msgque.c that could cause a segmentation fault in
	  the dequeue process sometimes
	* Davis station LOOP code did not wait for LOOP ack, causing dead
	  lock
	* the daemonize function was not complete yet, it did not yet start
	  a new session
	* make ${sysconfdir}/meteo.conf a default configuration file, so
	  that the -f flag is no longer strictly necessary, and updated
	  the documentation accordingly
	* simplify the start/stop script, as well as the meteojob script

Release 0.1.7:
	* fixed a bug in meteoavg.c, which did not daemonize by default,
	  and did not honor the -p option
	* some nasty Bourne shell bug on Solaris overly complicates
	  configuration on that platform
	* mailinglist has been set up
	* added watchdog functionality, but not tested thouroughly
	* fixed a bug in get_acknowledge that resulted in incorrect
	  behavior if the station did not reply

Release 0.1.6:
	* added documentation: meteo.html and meteodata.html
	* added the capability to become a daemon to the meteoavg, meteoloop
	  and meteodequeue programs
	* added a -a option to meteograph that forces the use of the average
	  table. Use the meteoavg program to fill the averages table
	* added an option to meteograph that allows to select the graphs to
	  be produced
	* message queues are now fully implemented to decouple data collection
	  from the wheather station and updates of the database. So if the
	  database blocks (e.g. because of a long running query), no data
	  from the station is lost.
	* fixed quite a serious bug in the computation of the total wind
	  speed. It worked for the Monitor, where the updates follow
	  roughly every second, but it failed for the vantage, where the
	  updates take 5 seconds.
	* fixed quite a serious unit conversion bug in the davis_loop
	  function
	* added wake up code: Vantage station needs a wake up signal before
	  the first command is sent
	* added speed directive to configuration file: serial speed is
	  now configurable
	* portability fixes for Linux
	* added generic functions to compute averages
	* added a program to compute averages after the fact
	* added a new table to the database to hold averages, so that the
	  computation of the averages doesn't take that much time any longer
	  (we should be able to do it from a CGI program)
	* unified configuration file reading with a single new function in
	  mconf.c

Release 0.1.5:
	* modify meteoloop so that it reads a configuration file
	* meteograph did not close the configuration file after being done
	  with it
	* allow to configure writer as well as the read only user from the
	  configuration file

Release 0.1.4:
	* fix a bug in labeling code, weekly labels were no longer displayed
	  after change to daylight saving time
	* implemented a configuration file scanner/parser to be
	  able to configure ranges and colors of the graphs without modifying
	  the source code
	* database connection parameters configurable through the configuration
	  file

Release 0.1.3:
	* fix bug in year labeling code, labels now appear
	* adapt precipitation display ranges to something more reasonable
	* fix dotted line for transparency

Release 0.1.2:
	* fix a bug in temperature max/min display (they were simply wrong)
	* added some support for message queues, not finished

Release 0.1.1:
	* improve the graphs with better scales for wind
	* improve the graph API by decoupling grid and ticks
	* added a sync function to the davis interface code (based on
	  the timed read)
	* added a time read function to the meteocom structure
	* add memory debugging to all source files
	* fix missing include for string.h in tcpcom.c

Release 0.1.0:
	* meteotest now retrieves a full data set and displays it in HTML
	* added conversion functions for temperature, wind speed and
	  barometric pressure
	* liboolized/automakeized/autoconfized/shtoolized the package
