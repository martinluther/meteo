How to upgrade from previous versions
=====================================

To 0.9.14
---------

The station table now includes longitude, latitude and altitude.

  mysql> alter table station add column longitude double not null;
  mysql> alter table station add column latitude double not null;
  mysql> alter table station add column altitude double not null;
  mysql> update station set longitude = ..., latitude = ..., altitude = ...
         where id = ...;

To 0.9.9-13
-------------------

No changes in the database were introduced in these releases, so upgrading
from 0.9.8 is trivial: just install over your current installation.

0.9.x to 0.9.{7,8}
------------------

- The database structure has changed slightly: the station table now has
  an additional offset column. The configuration of the station offset is
  no longer in the meteo.xml, but rather in the database. To add this
  column to an existing database, use the following mysql statements

    mysql> alter table station add column offset int not null<
    mysql> update station set offset = <our_offset>;

- The averaging has become configurable, thus you need to add an averages
  element to the station configuration. Check the sample meteo.xml in
  the distribution for a starting point.

This file is new in release 0.9.8, please look around older documentation
for hints about upgrading from older releases. Please also check the HTML
documentation.
