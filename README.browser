How to set up the meteo browser
===============================

Description
-----------

Starting with release 0.2.0, the meteo package includes a PHP script
that can be used as a browser to the meteo database. It allows to
view every day, week, month or year for which there is data in the
database (and for all the others as well, but that's less interesting).

Navigation is very simple: zooming in is accomplished by clicking
into the graphs, to zoom one uses the navigation bar, the same is
true for the `sideways' navigation.

Installation
------------

The browser uses only a single PHP script: meteobrowser.php. Put this
script wherever you want in your web server hierarchy. The directory
containing the script must also contain a directory named cache
writable by the web server, so that it can write images to this directory.

Also put the two  auxiliary files stationlist.inc and dummygettext.inc
into the same directory as meteobrowser.php, the latter only if your
PHP lacks gettext support (in which case you should uncomment the 
instructions to include it in meteobrowser.php, this file is there as
a preparation for later i18n usin gettext). The stationlist.inc
contains the definition of the meteo stations available, together with
a list of graphs that can be produced for these stations.

Make sure that for each station there is also a configuration file
/usr/local/etc/meteo-stationname.conf, as the meteobrowser.php script
calls meteograph with this configuration file for the station named
stationname. Set the $confpath variable at the beginning of the script 
to the directory containing the configuration files. Also configure 
the absolute path to the cache directory in $cachedir, and the full
path to the meteograph binary in $meteograph.

Maintenance
-----------

The cache directory should be cleaned out regularly. In principle,
all files older than a few hours can be removed from the directory.
