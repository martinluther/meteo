TODO
----

Wishes

* add timezone flag to meteodraw program, since some platforms ignore the
  timezone environment variable, notably Mac OS X

* add legend attribute to channel tag, which includes a legend in the graph

* test the new minimum range code in GraphWindow.cc

* update NEWS file

Bugs

* check 60 seconds graphs, there seem to be some problems with computed
  channels

* there seems to be a bug in the browser, where meteolabels are computed
  incorrectly and attributes show up multiple times

* on a make clean, remove the .mo files in browser/po
