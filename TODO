TODO

* There seems to be a bug somewhere in gcc 3.3, as/ld on Solaris 9 or
  even in Solaris nine that causes meteopoll to crash when an illegal
  humidity value is read from the station. The same code works on Linux
  and Mac OS X, so it's not an issue with endianness. I'll try to 
  with a new gcc compiled to use the GNU as and ld, as I have seen
  many cases in the past where switch from Solaris utilities to GNU
  utilities solved such problems.

* fix the wrong alignment (vertical) of the ImageMap

* missing classes: TimeConverter, TimeRecorder

* test the new minimum range code in GraphWindow.cc

* update NEWS file

Bugs

* on a make clean, remove the .mo files in browser/po

* make sure meteodraw does not crash with a segmentation fault when asked
  to draw a curve for data that does not exist (name not specified anywhere
  in the XML file)
