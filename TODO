TODO
----

* teach meteoloop how to compute averages and maintain the average table

* modify tables so that the group number can also be indexed

* create indexes to speed up search

* preform correct device locking when using a serial device

* in the davis access code, get the extreme values as well

* generalize the davis code for other weather stations

* include conversion functions to scientific units: K, mb, m/s etc

* add a separate process that consolidates averages to an extra table
  so they don't need to be recomputed every time the graphs are rebuilt

* use web colors in the graphs to avoid dither and false colors
