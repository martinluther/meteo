meteofixtimestamps
How_to_migrate
	Before 0.4.0, localtime was used as the key in the database,
	which caused various problems with daylight saving time. This
	utility converts the database to using Unix time as the key.
	The use of the utility is described in 


meteodbmigrate
How_to_migrate2
	Converts the database from pre 0.9.0 schema to the 0.9.0 schema.
	The migration is explained in How_to_migrate2.

meteojob
meteooverview
	The script meteojob is a sample script I run from cron to rebuild
	the graphs every five minutes. The pages that reference the graphs
	where originally generated by the meteooverview script.

rc.meteo
	Sample start/stop script to start all the processes needed
	for a full meteo installation.

meteo
StartupParameters.plist
	On Mac OS X, place these two files in /Library/StartupItems/meteo
	(you'll have to create this directory), which will start the
	meteo processes on Mac OS X after MySQL has been started.
