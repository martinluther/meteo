BUGS
----

- There is a known problem with gcc 3.3 (from sunfreeware.com) on Solaris 9:
  when an invalid humidity value is read, somewhere inside the code an
  exception is thrown, which is not caught by a matching catch statement.
  The same code works perfectly OK on Linux and Mac OS X, so it is quite
  obviously a platfrom related issue. Since I'm using a sunfreeware.com
  compiler, which is configured to use the Sun linker and assembler, it
  looks quite likely that they are to blame (note that mico has a similar
  problem: it will not work if built using Sun tools, due to bugs in 
  those tools).

  Update: using gcc 3.3.2 configured to use the GNU tools does not exhibit
  the problem. Although it is not quite clear now whether the compiler
  or linker/assembler are to blame, the fact that everything works with
  older versions of gcc on other platforms don't have the problem strongly
  indicates that it really is a problem with Suns linker or assembler.

- The old Davis stations are not tested at all right now, so they probably
  don't work.
