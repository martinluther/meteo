edit do-wu-update.sh
	Change the WEATHER_DIR variable to point to the directory
	where you have these files installed.

	A good location for these files is $HOME/weather

	Note: whatever user owns/runs these files needs to have
	a mysql user account and read access to the meteo tables in mysql


edit meteo-wu-fmt.pl - 

	set $db_user to the mysql username to use for reading
	the meteo tables

	set $db_passwd to the password for this user


edit wu-upload.pl

	set $ID to the ID weather underground assigned you for
	your weather station.

	If you don't yet have an ID, go to wunderground.com and get one.

	set $PASSWORD to the password you set for your weather station
	on the wunderground web site.

	set $WDATFILE to the pathname of the file which holds the
	meteo data to upload (the data written by meteo-wu-fmt.pl)

	Example: if you installed all this stuff in /home/foo/weather
	Then you would set

		my $WDATFILE="/home/foo/weather/meteo.out";
