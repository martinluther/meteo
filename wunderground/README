Sending meteo data to Wunderground
----------------------------------

These scripts were provided by Walter D Poxon

What's here and how to use it:

do-wu-update.log - a small (statically-sized) log file which shows the
	most recent data uploaded to weather underground (in a pretty
	raw format, but it's readable if you squint ;)

do-wu-update.sh - this is the "main" file in this directory.  Run this
	program whenever you want to upload data to weather underground.
	I have mine set to upload once every 5 minutes using the
	wu-update.cron file below)

	runs meteo-wu-fmt.pl and sticks the output in meteo.out
	runs wu-upload.pl which takes the data in meteo.out and
		uploads it to weather underground

meteo-wu-fmt.pl - reads fresh weather data from the mysql database,
	does some trivial calculations/conversions, and spits the
	data out in a format suitable for the upload script (wu-upload.pl)

meteo.out - temp file for holding latest weather data prior to upload

wu-update.cron - same crontab entry for invoking do-wu-update.sh
	to upload weather info to wunderground every 5 mins.

wu-upload.pl
