Using the Vantage Pro with a Lantronix UDS-10 Device Server
===========================================================

Connecting a weather station directly to a computer leads to some
risks. A cabled weather station connects to the console through a
rather long cable, so there are plenty of occasions  to  pick  up
very high voltages during thunderstorms. Even if not directly hit
by lightning, voltages much higher than  the  line  driver  built
into  the  console  of a Vantage Pro can handle can be coupled in
via ground, or via induction. The problem  for  the  computer  is
that  usually  these  high  voltages  also  appear  at the serial
interface, possible destroying the interface chips.

The station a Rossboda has a particularly  bad  history  in  this
respect.  It began as a webcam only site, with the webcam mounted
in the interior of the building. The webcam was not the  problem,
but  the  computer  managing the images an build MPEG videos from
the images was connected via a modem to the phone line. The phone
line  enters the building at a different place from the power, so
that in case of ligthning strikes somewhere  near  the  building,
there  were  quite  high  voltages between the two. About four or
five modems have been killed by lightning, until the  phone  line
was  replaced  by  ISDN. ISDN has the exact same problem, but now
it's no longer the computer that is hit (lighting also  destroyed
three  motherboards,  a particularly impressive incident made the
serial line driver chips explode, one could see  the  blank  chip
because   the   plastic  case  exploded),  but  rather  the  line
termination unit owned by the telephone company.  This  unit  has
been replaced at least three times during the last year.

After I installed the Vantage Pro, everything went quite well for
a  while,  winter and spring did not bring any severe storms. But
during summer, the station was hit so badly that the console  was
destroyed,  and  its electronics had to be replaced. The computer
was not affected by this, because the  station  is  not  directly
connected  to  the  computer.   instead, I use a Lantronix UDS-10
device server connected to the console via its serial  port.  The
connection  to  the  computer  is via ethernet.  So there are two
additional devices between the station and the computer that will
be  destroyed  before  the  computer  gets hit: the device server
(with its own power supply and ground) and a small  ethernet  hub
(costs only 40$).

Of course, I don't really want to pay for  more  repairs  of  the
console,  so  I  added  a surge protector circuit from Meteolabor
(www.meteolabor.ch).  They build very fine devices and have  vast
experience  with  lightning  and  NEMP  protection  (they also do
military projects for NEMP protection).  If this  setup  survives
the storm season in autumn, we can say "problem solved!".

Connecting the Lantronix UDS-10 to a Vantage Pro
------------------------------------------------

The Vantage Pro comes with a connector  suitable  for  the  9-pin
COM1/2  serial  ports  on  a PC. The UDS-10 has a 25pin old style
connector. Both are really overkill, as the Vantage Pro only uses
ground  and  TxD and RxD.  To connect the Vantage Pro to the UDS-
10, you must use a null-modem connector, i.e.  the  RxD  and  TxD
lines  must  be  crossed  (the UDS-10 behaves like a PC as far as
wiring is concerned, you could directly connect a modem).

Configuring the Lantronix UDS-10
--------------------------------

You don't need any special  softare  installed  on  your  system,
everything  you  need are a few standard utilities installed with
any reasonable Unix system.

Please read the UDS-10's documentation to learn how to set the IP
address  and  netmask  parameters.  As soon as you have a working
network configuration, you can connect to port 9999 on the UDS-10
and get the configuration dialog. The following settings work for
me:

    *** basic parameters
    Hardware: Ethernet Autodetect
    IP addr 192.168.007.003, gateway 192.168.007.001,netmask 255.255.255.000

    ***************** Channel 1 *****************
    Baudrate 19200, I/F Mode 4C, Flow 00
    Port 10001
    Remote IP Adr: --- none ---, Port 00000
    Connect Mode: C0  Disconn Mode: 00
    Flush   Mode: 00

Note that the UDS-10 has some  clever  modes  to  reduce  network
usage  by  grouping  several characters in a single packet. While
this is great for terminal applications,  it  really  isn't  that
great for a weather station, where the time when the data arrives
at the computer also plays some role (e.g.  for  computations  of
rain rate or wind speed), this is why the flush modes are 00.
